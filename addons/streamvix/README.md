### Administrative Endpoints

The add-on provides several administrative endpoints:

- `/live/update` - Update live events immediately
- `/live/purge` - Purge old events
- `/live/reload` - Reload catalog without re-running script
- `/admin/mode?fast=1` - Enable FAST dynamic mode
- `/admin/mode?fast=0` - Return to extractor mode

## Operating Modes

### FAST Mode (Direct URLs)
- Activated with `FAST_DYNAMIC=true` or runtime endpoint
- Skips extractor and uses direct URLs from JSON
- No concurrency limits, all sources exposed as direct streams
- All FAST streams labeled with `[Player Esterno]` prefix

### Extractor Mode (Default)
- Each dynamic URL passes through resolution (if MFP configured)
- Applies concurrency cap (`DYNAMIC_EXTRACTOR_CONC`)
- Sources beyond cap exposed as direct leftover streams
- Priority: Italian titles first, then other Italian sources, then others

## Scheduling

The Live.py script runs automatically every 2 hours starting from 08:10 Europe/Rome:
- 08:10, 10:10, 12:10, 14:10, 16:10, 18:10, 20:10, 22:10, 00:10, 02:10, 04:10, 06:10
- Physical purge of old events occurs at 02:05 with safety reload at 02:30
